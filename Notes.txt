Do slider with pictures floating at different deepth, we can go right or left, it is infinite, if we click a pictures
we move camera in front of the picture and if we click again we go back. The pictures will be floating randomly in the space
like fairy dust. When moving do a move effect that distort the space or view.

Do the slider like if you were inside a sphere

Maybe do a medieval theme, with medieval paintings and rotating around wall

And maybe make a game, that you can completly move around the space and rotate camera and interact with the pictures

Use rapier as physic engine
